# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 43
**Apparel Exports to the US since COVID**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 43 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w43-apparel-exports-to-us) monthly gaps for 6 countries (1 chart per) between 2019 exports and 2020 exports, for each month between March and June.  

## Data Source
Data comes from OTEXA [here](https://otexa.trade.gov/msrpoint.htm) and was written about in a research memo written by [Penn State University](https://www.workersrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Unpaid-Billions_October-6-2020.pdf)

## My Approach for Week 43
The approach was to allow users the ability to select countries and view statistics for each.  To tone down the color pallete a bit.
